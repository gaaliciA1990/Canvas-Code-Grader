## Canvas-Code Master's Capstone
The final project of the master's program, completed in 20 weeks (across two 8 week quarters and winter break). Assigned to a group of 6, including myself, we were tasked with providing a solution to simplyfy grading coding assignments SU's CS undergrad coding assginments. The current system has requires both instructors and students to manage two separate systems, with Canvas being the source of truth for the grades. Additionally, the current process has duplicated work for the instructor due to managing two separate systems. We were tasked with finding a solution to allow Canvas to manage CS coding assignments so that; 1) students are notified if their submission compiles prior to submitting the assignment on Canvs, 2) instructors & graders can view the student code submissions in Canvas SpeedGrader next to the grading rubric, and 3) be able to interact with the student's code submission during run time (i.e. enter input prompts), in the SpeedGrader on Canvas. 

This repository contains the entire code base for the capstone projet, as well as all of the documentation associated with the project.
